This is a point and click detective game made during Global Game Jam 2016.

The player controls a detective trying to solve a new murder by the same killer behind his wife's murder. 
The game features a short story that is not yet completed (Due to the gamejam time and the team artist getting food poisoning)

WARNING: There are some detective based puns which may cause laughter or disturb those with a natural distaste for puns.
